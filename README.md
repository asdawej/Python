# Python - asdawej's test projects

***Tree & Codes***

> For essay of decrete mathematics. A big success.

***NormalRandomLearning***

> A learning model trying to transform a uniformed random number generator to a normal random number generator by machine learning.

***DesktopNote***

> A notebook used on the desktop in a cmd interface.
> To install, first you should download DesktopNote.exe in the release _DesktopNote_, then run
> ```PowerShell
> python -m setup
> ```
> It will create a file _note.dat_, putting it with _DesktopNote.exe_ in the same directory, and then run it!
> 
> _v1.1.0:_ **In the new release v1.1.0, you just need to run _DesktopNote.exe_ and _setup.py_ was deleted.**
> Now it will be handled in an independent project: [DesktopNote](https://github.com/asdawej/DesktopNote).

***EasyConsole***

> A console that has a fast way to get a file. [EasyConsole](https://github.com/asdawej/EasyConsole)

***__modules/***

> ***LinkedList***
> 
> > In hand but now do not doing now.
> 
> ***PyMatrix***
> 
> > In hand.
> > 
> > Now, it is a independent project: [PyMatrix](https://github.com/asdawej/PyMatrix), and thus I do not track it here.

***FAILED/***

> ***Curve_Fit***
> 
> > First practice of machine learning, half-success and half-failure.
> 
> ***Evolution_Simulator***
> 
> > Practice of evoultion model, failure with unknown reason.
> 
> ***Test_Learning_Model***
> 
> > Reasonable designed but do not get the expected effect.
> 
> ***Module_Lines_Dictionary***
> 
> > A project started with the aim of learning new language and modules and to store, arrange, and search in lines.
> > 
> > However, not familiar with file io and not using C language led to its failure and being given up.
